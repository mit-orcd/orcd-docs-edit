# Data Security and Privacy

## What data can be stored?

All ORCD current systems are only suitable for storing data with low-level security requirements. This means that they are not to be used to store sensitive data, such as personal information, financial information, or intellectual property. Additionally, they are not to be used to store data that is subject to use agreements that require security controls or audit tracking.

The following data categories are appropriate for storing and analyzing on current ORCD systems:

- Open public data
- Low-sensitivity private research data- items such as drafts of papers and analyses derived from public data

<!--
Section above and below seem to be saying the same thing, do we need both? Maybe keep the second one?
-->

The following data types are suitable for ORCD systems:

- Anything in the low-risk category described at the [MIT IS&T data risk classification pages](https://infoprotect.mit.edu/risk-classifications)
- Drafts of unpublished research papers and results that are based on low-risk data

Anything else in the medium-risk or higher risk levels of the [MIT IS&T data risk classification pages](https://infoprotect.mit.edu/risk-classifications) should not be stored or analyzed on current ORCD systems.

If you have any questions about whether your data is appropriate for storing on ORCD systems please feel free to reach out to us at <orcd-help@mit.edu>. 

## Where can more sensitive data be processed and stored?

The ORCD team is currently developing a system for more sensitive data. If you have sensitive data and would like to learn about our plans please feel free to get in touch at <orcd-help@mit.edu>.
