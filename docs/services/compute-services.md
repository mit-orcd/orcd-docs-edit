# Compute Services

Researchers can upgrade their [base-level](../running-jobs/overview.md#partitions) computing service for a per-account monthly account maintenance fee to get:

- Higher priority access to available compute resources
- Higher compute resource limits
- Longer job times
- Access to advance rentals

The current resources limits that come with a Standard and Advanced account maintenance fee are:

|  | Standard | Advanced  |
| ----------- | ----------- |----------- |
| CPU cores<br>mit_normal | 256 | 512 |
| GPUs<br>mit_normal_gpu | 2 | 4 |
| Memory | 1024 GB | 2048 GB |
| Time limit<br>mit_normal | 2 days | 4 days |
| Time limit<br>mit_normal_gpu | 1 day | 2 days |
| Priority | Medium | Higher |

The charge for each can be found on the main ORCD site [Storage and Compute Services](https://orcd.mit.edu/resources/storage-and-compute-services) page.

For any questions or to upgrade your account please reach out to us at <orcd-help@mit.edu>.

## Advance Rentals

Advance rentals, available to those with a Standard or Advanced account level, provide researchers guaranteed time slots for specific compute equipment (subject to availability and request lead time). We do this through reservations in Slurm.

The charge can be found on the main ORCD site [Storage and Compute Services](https://orcd.mit.edu/resources/storage-and-compute-services) page.

For any questions or to request an advanced rental reservation please reach out to us at <orcd-help@mit.edu>.
