While using the command line is often fast and efficient, we often just need to use a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

This process allows you to use the cluster and present a GUI to your desktop machine using X11 (Mac, Windows or Linux). 

Step one is to ssh to the cluster log in node. 

ssh -Y jmurray1@orcd-login001.mit.edu
 
Duo two-factor login for jmurray1
 
Enter a passcode or select one of the following options:
 
 1. Duo Push to XXX-XXX-XXXX
 2. Phone call to XXX-XXX-XXXX
 3. SMS passcodes to XXX-XXX-XXXX
 
Passcode or option (1-3): 1
 
Pushed a login request to your device...
Success. Logging you in...

Once you are logged in you create your allocation in slurm using X11 option at the end:

salloc -N 1 -n 4 --mem-per-cpu=4G -p mit_normal --x11

Load the module you want to use: 

module load matlab

matlab & 

Note that the performance will be affected by the network connection speed. For example, if you are connected via a wired connection the performance should be far better than if you try to use this technique over wifi.
