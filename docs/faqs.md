# Frequently Asked Questions

**How do I get GPU access?**

Currently we have many public GPUs available to the MIT community on Satori and
we are working on getting more on Engaging. You can request GPUs for your job
by following [this documentation](running-jobs/requesting-resources.md#gpus).

If your lab would like to purchase GPUs to be hosted on Engaging, please contact
<orcd-help-engaging@mit.edu>.

**How do I check the status of my job?**

Instructions for checking job status can be found
[here](running-jobs/overview.md#checking-job-status).

**How can I submit a module request?**

We are open to creating new modules for the Engaging cluster. You can submit all
module requests to <orcd-help-engaging@mit.edu>.

**I am unable to install a package in R. How can I debug the issue?**

We reccomend using Conda to manage R packages. Please refer to the
[R user guide](software/R.md).

**Can I use export controlled software on the cluster?**

Export controlled software has specific requirements around who is allowed to
access the software. Often, our clusters do not meet these requirements, so
we generally do not allow this software to be on our systems. Please refer to
the terms of use of the software and direct any questions to
<orcd-help@mit.edu>.
